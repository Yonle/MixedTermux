MixedTermux
===========
A script that mixing your termux with some command from one of your distros. Using proot-distro in order to work

Installing
==========
You may mix your termux instantly by doing this:

  curl -sL git.io/mixedtermux | sh

After installation, It does not print any output. This is NORMAL. After doing that, You may do `apk update`. Enjoy

Configuration
=============
See ~/.mixedtermuxrc file

Sound Support
=============
Start pulseaudio by executing this command

  pulseaudio --start --exit-idle-time=-1

Pulseaudio is known to be Battery intensive, So you should kill it often after finishing using pulseaudio

  pulseaudio --kill

Or, if you want to start pulseaudio so it has sound support everytime you execute some command, You may execute this command (Note: Execute once. Twice will cause fatal problem):

  echo "! pulseaudio --check && pulseaudio --start --exit-idle-time=-1" >> ~/.mixedtermuxrc

Uninstalling step is very easy. Just do this:

  pkg reinstall command-not-found bash termux-tools
